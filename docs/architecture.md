# Architecture

## Key design decisions

- **Phase-1 HLS over MediaMTX / go2rtc.** iOS Safari is strict about
  HLS conformance — we tried MediaMTX and go2rtc; both failed on DVB-
  C's interlaced SEI-laden streams. Pure ffmpeg-per-channel with 1 s
  segments and a 2 h sliding DVR window works reliably.
- **Per-channel transcode rules**: H.264 HD is `-c:v copy` (AAC remux
  for audio because iOS doesn't do AC-3). MPEG-2 SD is re-encoded
  through libx264 ultrafast with explicit `setsar=1` so iOS renders
  anamorphic content at the correct 16:9 display aspect (otherwise
  SD channels show up as 4:3).
- **Warm-tuner LRU + UI pins**: switching channel does not immediately
  stop the previous stream. LRU cache (`MAX_WARM_STREAMS`) plus any
  channels pinned via the UI (📌 on the startpage, persisted to
  `.always_warm.json`) keep running so the 2 h DVR buffer stays
  populated for instant time-shift. Pin cap is **dynamic**, derived
  from real tuner usage: `TUNER_TOTAL - 1 - active_dvr` plus a mux-
  sharing bonus — two pins on the same transponder cost one tuner, so
  the cap grows by 1. Tuner count is read live from tvheadend
  `/api/status/inputs` (entries with `subs > 0`). Header badge
  `📡 n/4 Tuner` on the startpage reflects this in real time; tap on a
  green warm-badge stops the LRU channel to free its tuner. Mux
  groupings are visualised with coloured dots next to each channel.
- **Pin idle-timeout**: a pinned channel that hasn't had a viewer in
  `PIN_IDLE_HOURS` (default 6 h) is stopped and marked dormant in
  `_dormant_pins`. The always-warm loop won't respawn a dormant pin;
  `ensure_running` (called on viewer tap) clears the flag. UI shows a
  💤 icon on the pin button for dormant channels. Saves tuner +
  electricity for the "always warm just in case" use case.
- **Mediathek live as primary source for public broadcasters**:
  watch player first tries the Mediathek live HLS (via hls.js + MSE)
  for any channel in `MEDIATHEK_LIVE`. Falls back to our ffmpeg
  pipeline only if Mediathek doesn't answer in 8 s or emits a fatal
  hls.js error. Frees a DVB-C tuner per public channel someone's
  watching.
- **Virtual Mediathek recordings + pre-expiry rip**: long-press on
  an EPG event on an ARD/ZDF channel offers "Aus Mediathek
  speichern". The entry is saved in `.mediathek_recordings.json` as
  `mt_<hash>` → played back via hls.js on click. A background worker
  (`_mediathek_rip_loop`) ffmpeg-`-c copy`'s the stream to a local
  MP4 48 h before the Mediathek expiry so the show survives past
  Mediathek availability. Rate-limited by loadavg and free-disk.
  `_mediathek_autorec_loop` automatically creates these virtuals
  for every autorec-spawned DVR entry on a Mediathek channel, so
  series recordings also get the Mediathek backup.
- **Past-event Mediathek**: tapping a past EPG event routes through
  the long-press modal instead of navigating to the live stream.
  Old archive entries without an event_id get a synthetic
  `arc_<slug>_<start>` id the lookup endpoint understands, so
  yesterday's Tatort still finds its Mediathek match.
- **Hot-reload without buffer loss**: editing `service.py` triggers an
  in-container file watcher (mtime poll) that does `os.execv` on the
  Python process. ffmpegs are spawned with `start_new_session=True`
  and tracked via a PID file (`.ffmpeg.pid` per channel) so the new
  image adopts them on startup. `docker restart` still nukes them
  (cgroup teardown), so it's deliberately avoided for code changes.
  See [operations.md](operations.md#deploying-code-changes-sighup-not-compose-restart)
  for the deploy procedure.
- **Live commercial detection**: a background loop (`_live_adskip_loop`)
  picks one warm private-sender channel every 30 s, concatenates the
  last 30 min of TS segments (raw `cat` — self-synchronising, much
  faster than `ffmpeg -f concat`), and runs comskip. Ad blocks are
  stored keyed by wall-clock via `EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME`, so
  rewinding into the buffer on a warm channel lets the player skip
  commercials. Re-scanned every ~12 min so fresh content gets picked
  up. Public broadcasters are excluded (no regular ad breaks).
  Currently offloaded to the Mac via `LIVE_ADS_OFFLOAD=mac` — see
  [mac-handlers.md](mac-handlers.md).
- **Recording playback via lazy HLS-VOD remux**. tvheadend stores as
  `.ts` with `content-disposition: attachment`, which iOS treats as
  a download. We remux on demand into an HLS-VOD playlist under
  `_rec_<uuid>/` served by Caddy, with ads flagged by `comskip` on a
  background worker.
- **Mediathek fallback for seeking beyond the local buffer.** iOS
  Safari native HLS has not allowed seeking in live playlists since
  iOS 8. For ARD/ZDF/arte/KiKA we bundle `hls.js` on the client with
  `forceMseHlsOnAppleDevices:true` so MSE kicks in (requires Safari
  17.1+), and the public broadcaster HLS endpoints act as our
  longer-history source for past shows.
- **Now-Next APIs for precise show-start seeking.** Chapter-tick taps
  call `/api/show-actual-start/<slug>?ts=<epg>` which consults ARDs
  `programm-api.ard.de/nownext` REST API or ZDFs `getEpg` GraphQL
  persisted-query. Both return an `effectiveAirtimeBegin` (or
  `currentStartDate`) that can differ by seconds to minutes from the
  scheduled EPG slot. Uncovered channels fall back to EPG time + a
  per-channel lead-in.

## File layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `hls-gateway/service.py` | waitress-served Flask app (~5k LOC): HLS orchestration, EPG archive, live + recording + Mediathek players, autorec series, virtual Mediathek recordings, live ad-skip, Now-Next bridge, file-watcher hot-reload |
| `hls-gateway/Dockerfile` | two-stage: ARM64 native build of comskip from source, then runtime with static ffmpeg 8.1 (BtbN) + libargtable2 + libsdl2, `pip install flask waitress` |
| `hls-gateway/docker-compose.yml` | Mounts `/mnt/tv` + `service.py`, runs as uid 1000 (SSD writes non-root), json-file log rotation 50 MB × 3 |
| `caddy/Caddyfile` | HTTPS on :8443 with local CA, static `seg_*.ts` served via sendfile, `.m3u8` and `/recording/*` reverse-proxied to Flask, `.ts` forced to `Content-Type: video/mp2t` (Caddy auto-detects as Qt-linguist without this override) |
| `tvheadend/docker-compose.yml` | linuxserver image, `/mnt/tv` mounted for recordings |
| `mac/` | Mac-side launchd handler scripts (`tv-comskip.sh`, `tv-live-comskip.py`) — see [mac-handlers.md](mac-handlers.md) |
| `comskip/` | Local patches against upstream Comskip — see [comskip.md](comskip.md) |

### State files (persisted on SSD, survive container restart)

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/mnt/tv/hls/.always_warm.json` | Pinned channels + last-viewer timestamps |
| `/mnt/tv/hls/.mediathek_recordings.json` | Virtual Mediathek recordings (metadata, HLS URL, rip status, expiry) |
| `/mnt/tv/hls/.live_ads.json` | Detected ad blocks per channel (PDT-keyed, survives hot-reload) |
| `/mnt/tv/hls/.epg_archive.jsonl` | 14-day EPG archive with auto-compaction |
| `/mnt/tv/hls/.usage_stats.json` | Start-count + watch-hours per channel |
| `/mnt/tv/hls/.codec_cache.json` | ffprobe results (H.264 vs MPEG-2) |
| `/mnt/tv/hls/.mac-comskip-alive` | Heartbeat from the Mac handler — Pi defers rec work when fresh (<5 min) |
| `/mnt/tv/hls/<slug>/.ffmpeg.pid` | Child PID + start-time for re-adoption after hot-reload |
| `/mnt/tv/hls/<slug>/.adskip/` | comskip artefacts for live ad detection |
| `/mnt/tv/hls/_rec_<uuid>/` | Remuxed HLS-VOD of tvheadend recordings + comskip cutlist |
| `/mnt/tv/hls/_rec_<uuid>/.scanning` | Cooperative lock-file: Mac/Pi don't race on the same recording |
| `/mnt/tv/hls/_<mt_uuid>/file.mp4` | Ripped Mediathek MP4s (pre-expiry backup) |

## Player UI (Live + Recording share the look)

- Chrome fades after 3.5 s; tap video to toggle
- Top-bar: `⛶` fullscreen left, `⊟`/`⊞` minimal-controls toggle, `✕` close right
- Bottom scrub bar with played (red) · buffered (grey) · full-window
  (dim). For recordings: `.ad-block` diagonal-hatch overlays from
  comskip
- Controls row: `⏮` (jump-to-show-start) · `⏪10s` · play/pause · `⏩10s`
  · `⏭` (skip-to-live, live player only) · `◀︎`/`▶︎` (channel, live
  only) · wall-clock counter or `live` badge
- **Minimal-controls mode** (toggle persisted in localStorage): hides
  every button in the row except a quiet `Werbung ⏭` pill, leaves
  scrubbar + `#cur` timer + title visible. Live edge is reachable by
  dragging the scrub thumb to the rightmost 2 % (snap-to-live).
- Title row: channel name · colored source badge (`Live` red / `ARD
  Mediathek` blue / `ZDF Mediathek` / `arte.tv` / `KiKA`) · EPG-now
- Chapter-ticks on the scrub bar: reachable events only (filtered
  against local seekable-range and per-channel Mediathek window); tap
  jumps to `currentStartDate` if authoritative API knows, else EPG
  time ± per-channel lead-in
- Hint-toasts are silenced for routine actions ("Sprung an Werbeblock-
  Ende" etc.) — only true errors like "Buffer leer" or
  "Recording-Fehler" still pop.
